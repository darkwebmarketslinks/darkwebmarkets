# Top Dark Web Markets in 2025  

> The advent of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Monero has been a game changer for dark web markets. Cryptocurrencies provide a decentralized and (relatively) anonymous way to facilitate transactions. Monero, in particular, is favored due to its enhanced privacy features, which conceal the sender, recipient, and amount of each transaction.
These technologies create a secure environment for both buyers and sellers, making it challenging for authorities to trace transactions or shut down operations.
